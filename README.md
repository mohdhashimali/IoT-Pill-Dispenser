# IoT-Pill-Dispenser
**Overview**

 _INTRODUCTION_
 
 Medication adherence is a critical component of effective healthcare management,
 particularly for patients with chronic diseases or those requiring long-term medication
 regimens. Non-adherence to prescribed medications can lead to severe health complications,
 increased hospitalizations, and higher healthcare costs. Traditional methods of medication
 management, such as pill organizers and manual reminders, are often insufficient and prone
 to errors.
 
 The Internet of Things (IoT) offers promising solutions to address these challenges by
 integrating smart devices into everyday healthcare practices. An IoT-based medical pill
 dispenser can significantly enhance medication adherence by automating the process of
 medication management. This smart pill dispenser is designed to dispense the correct
 dosage of medication at the prescribed times, providing timely reminders and notifications
 to patients and their caregivers.
 
 The system leverages IoT technology to ensure accurate and reliable dispensing of
 medication. It consists of several key components, including LED indicators, Button and
 LCDDisplay. The motors and gears work together to dispense the correct dosage, while the
 LED indicator and LCD Display provides real-time alerts, enabling caregivers to monitor
 the patient’s medication adherence remotely.

  The primary objectives of this project are to improve medication adherence, reduce the
 risk of missed or incorrect doses, and enhance the overall health management of patients.
 By automating the medication management process, the IoT-based pill dispenser aims to
 provide a user-friendly and reliable solution that can be particularly beneficial for the elderly
 and those with chronic health conditions.
 
 This project explores the design, implementation, and testing of the IoT-based medical pill
 dispenser. The system’s functionality, performance, and user satisfaction are evaluated to
 ensure it meets the requirements and provides a significant improvement over traditional
 medication management methods.
